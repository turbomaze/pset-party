Pset Party
====================================================================
A Meteor.js app that helps MIT students find pset buddies.

## Usage
When users navigate to the [Pset Party homepage](), they're prompted to
enter their Kerberos (any username, really). Once they've done so, they can
browse the list of current pset groups or create one of their own.

### Accounts
There's no security in terms of Kerberos verification because it doesn't really
matter what name users type in.

### Party Prning
The creator/owner of a pset party must click a button every half hour [TBD] to keep
their party on the front-page listing [WIP]. This prevents stale rooms from introducing
clutter. Alternatively, creators can delete their parties on their own [WIP].
